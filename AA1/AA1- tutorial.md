Validate the Nonce for a Chain of Blocks 
=======================


In this activity, you will validate the nonce for a chain of blocks with different techniques.


1. Load the template.
* Download the template.webloc for activity.

2. Add transactions to the ledger.
* Add transactions to the ledger from the network after a specified time set in the timer.

3. Add transactions to the block.
* Add transactions from the ledger to a block.

4. Add a timely counter for nonce.


* Add a counter which refreshes a counter after a specified set of time and connect it as a nonce.

5. Verify the counter nonce with the hash.
* Validate the counter nonce until it matches with the part of the hash value of the block.
