*  Import the downloaded file to the sandbox platform.


2. Create a block of transactions.
* Create a block of transactions using ledger, network and add timely transactions.

3. Add a timely counter for nonce.


* Add a counter which refreshes a counter after a specified set of time and connect it as a nonce.

4. Verify the counter nonce with the hash.
* Validate the counter nonce until it matches with the part of the hash value of the block.

5. Verify the random nonce with the hash
* Validate the random nonce by replacing counter with random component and verify until it matches with the part of the hash value of the block.
